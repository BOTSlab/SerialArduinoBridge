# SerialArduinoBridge

Used to control various Arduino powered robots via a serial connection.

This package is an adaptation of ROSArduinoBridge (which is itself adapted from the ArbotiX driver).  The following is the original description of ROSArduinoBridge:

 
    A set of simple serial commands to control a differential drive
    robot and receive back sensor and odometry data. Default 
    configuration assumes use of an Arduino Mega + Pololu motor
    controller shield + Robogaia Mega Encoder shield.  Edit the
    readEncoder() and setMotorSpeed() wrapper functions if using 
    different motor controller or encoder method.

    Created for the Pi Robot Project: http://www.pirobot.org

    Inspired and modeled after the ArbotiX driver by Michael Ferguson
